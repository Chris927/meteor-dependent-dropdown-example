# What is it?

Experiments on how to use dependent drop downs (first drop down determines what
appears in second drop down, second drop down selects something).

There are two collections for this, namely `Catetories` and `Things`, whereas
each `Thing` belongs to a `Category`.

The master branch contains a solution with session variables, branch
`using-reactive-var` uses ReactiveVar instead.

# How to run?

Just run `meteor` (meteor 0.9 or higher required), then navigate to
http://localhost:3000.

# So what?

Well, these are just experiments. Feedback or improvement suggestions or
alternatives welcome.
